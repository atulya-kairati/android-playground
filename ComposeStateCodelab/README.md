# State in Compose

- State is anything that can change over time and needs to be remembered and presented to the user through UI.
- State can can range from a variable to a DB.
- Any action that causes the modification of state is called an "event".
- Events are inputs generated from outside or inside an application, such as:
	- The user interacting with the UI by, for example, pressing a button.
	- Other factors, such as sensors sending a new value, or network responses.

- While the state of the app offers a description of what to display in the UI, events are the mechanism through which the state changes, resulting in changes to the UI.

- **Event** - An event is generated by the user or another part of the program.
- **Update State** - An event handler changes the state that is used by the UI.
- **Display State** - The UI is updated to display the new state.


- Compose apps build a description of the UI called *Composition* by calling compose functions.
- If the state changes, then then the parts depending on that state are *Re-Composed*.

- **The Composition**: a description of the UI built by Jetpack Compose when it executes composables.

- **Initial composition**: creation of a Composition by running composables the first time.

- **Recomposition**: re-running composables to update the Composition when data changes.

- Compose has a special state tracking system in place that schedules recompositions for any composables that read a particular state. This lets Compose be granular and just recompose those composable functions that need to change, not the whole UI. This is done by tracking not only "writes" (that is, state changes), but also "reads" to the state.

- Compose tracks variable which are of type `State` or `MutableState` (But it must be used with remember and its variants).

- Compose keeps track of each composable that reads State value properties and triggers a recomposition when its value changes. 

- **Remember**: remember stores objects in the Composition, and forgets the object if the source location where remember is called is not invoked again during a recomposition.
